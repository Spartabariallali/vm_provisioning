### Manipulating files/directories
- learning to move files from local machine to the virtual machine 
- to do so we use the sink_files feature in vagrant

### Error handling 
- running the vm this morning returned the error that "the vm was creatred with a user that doesnt match the current user 
- check hidden files and remove .vagrant file
